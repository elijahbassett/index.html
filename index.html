         <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p>    Hello, my name is Elijah Bassett. Ever since I can remember, I've been captivated by the power of music and technology. Growing up, I found myself lost in the melodies of classic soul and jazz, with Otis Redding being one of my favorites. As I’ve grown older, I discovered another passion in the world of technology and design. </p>
         <p>    I hope to build upon my knowledge of web design and learning more efficient ways in web development. Currently, I'm diving into the world of web design, where I'm learning how to blend creativity with web design. With each new project, I strive to create something that provide a new outlook. As I embark on this journey, I'm excited to combine my love for storytelling with the technical skills I'm developing. My ultimate goal is to use web design as a stepping stone to a career in business analysis, where I can help companies make data-driven decisions that align with their vision and values.    </p>

        <h2>Avatar</h2>
         <p>    Otis Redding, known as the "King of Soul," was a groundbreaking American singer, songwriter, and record producer whose influence on soul music is unmatched. Born in Macon, Georgia, in 1941, Otis Redding's career was tragically cut short when he died in a plane crash at the age of 26. Despite his brief career, he left behind a legacy that continues to resonate across generations today.  </p>
         <p>    Redding's music was characterized by his powerful voice and heartfelt lyrics. His ability to blend multiple genres of music like gospel, rnb, and rock 'n' roll helped shape the sound of soul music in the 1960s. Beyond his chart-topping hits, Otis was known for his electrifying live performances. His appearance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival is often cited as one of the greatest live performances in music history. This performance helped introduce soul music to a wider, more diverse audience, bridging cultural divides and paving the way for future African American artists in the industry. </p>

         <h2>Aspirations</h2>
         <p>    As I continue my studies in web design, I'm also looking forward to expanding my skill set in business analysis. My goal is to become a business analyst who is more on the technical side. I believe that understanding the needs of both businesses and users is key to creating solutions that are effective. </p>
         <p>    In the near future, I hope to leverage my web design skills to create intuitive dashboards and analytical tools that help businesses make informed decisions. By using the tools we learn in this class I can create websites using analytical data in my portfolio. I want to use my creativity not just to design beautiful websites but to craft solutions that drive success and innovation. </p>
         <p>    Ultimately, my dream is to combine the technical expertise I've gained with my passion for storytelling, just like Otis did with his music. I see myself working with companies to transform data into insights, helping them grow and thrive in a digital landscape. With Otis Redding as my avatar, I’m ready to take on whatever challenges come my way.</p>
